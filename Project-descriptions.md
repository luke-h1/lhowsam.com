this API

* Automation 
```
 I am a huge advocate for infrastructure automation as this
allows teams to focus on innovating new features and solving new
problems rather than being backlogged with maintaining
infrastructure. In this project I made Ansible playbooks & Bash
scripts that automate the setup of Linux & Mac OS X workstations
& servers

* Form Validator (maybe replace this with another project...) 
```
In this project I built a form validator that uses built in
javascript regular expressions to validate name, email, postcode
& phone numbers.

* quotes app 
````
  In this project I made a quotes app that pulls data from
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/RocktimSaikia/anime-chan"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >
                  {' '}
                  this
                </a>{' '}
                API with Vanilla javascript and bootstrap. This was a really fun
                API to work with and made the development of this app enjoyable.
