When you're working on a project, it's very common to name a branch the wrong way or make a typo. This happens quite a lot so let's quickly cover how to fix this common mistake. 

## 

## How to rename a local Git branch

Before you run the below commands, make sure you're on the branch you want to rename: 

```
git checkout old-name
```


To rename a branch locally use the -m option:

```
git branch -m new-name
```

## How to rename a remote Git branch

1. you will need to rename a local branch by following the previous steps 
2. Delete the old branch and push the new one: 
```
git push -u origin --delete old-name
```
3. Reset the upstream branch for your new local branch and you're done! 
```
git push -u origin new-name 
```
