### This deployment example uses Postgres, Redis & Node 


## Cloud providers

Before getting started with the below steps you will need to open up the following ports regardless of whether you use Digital Ocean or AWS

* 80: For Nginx 
* http/https ports
* 22: For ssh 

 Install Dokku & Docker for Ubuntu: 

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https

wget -nv -O - https://packagecloud.io/dokku/dokku/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -

OS_ID="$(lsb_release -cs 2>/dev/null || echo "bionic")"

echo "deb https://packagecloud.io/dokku/dokku/ubuntu/ ${OS_ID} main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dokku.list

sudo apt update -y 

wget -nv -O - https://get.docker.com/ | sudo bash -

sudo apt update

sudo apt install dokku -y
```

## Example app 

You can find an example of a full stack application that has been deployed with the below steps <a href="https://github.com/luke-h1/tmtodos.me" target="_blank" referrer="no referrer">here</a>  


##

VPS / EC2
- create new VPS with dokku image or install dokku yourself 
- go to VM IP address in browser
- check virtual hosts option
- ssh into VPS
- create a dokku app (this will be the API)
````
dokku apps:create <API_NAME>
```` 
- install the postgres dokku plugin 

``` 
sudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-postgres.git 
```

- create the database 

```
dokku postgres:create <DATABASE_NAME>
```
- Link postgres to the API 

```
dokku postgres:link <DATABASE_NAME> <API_NAME>
```

- Install redis: 
```
sudo dokku plugin:install 
https://github.com/dokku/dokku-redis.git
```

- create redis instance: 

```
sudo dokku redis:create <REDIS_INSTANCE_NAME>
```

- Link the redis instance to the API 

```
dokku redis:link <REDIS_INSTANCE_NAME> <API_NAME>
```

- run the following command & make postgres & redis are running
``` 
docker container list
``` 


##

Locally 

 comment out any old migrations 

 Generate an initial migration (this will be responsible for creating the initial tables on the production database)  

 Create a repository on Docker hub 

 Create a Dockerfile image locally (this will be responsible for building & running the backend for production) with 

```
docker build -t <USER>/app:1.0.0 . 
```

 Push the Docker image up to Docker hub 
```
docker push <USER>/app:1.0.0
```
##

VPS / EC2 
 Pull the Docker image you've pushed up to Docker hub: 


```
docker pull <USERNAME>/<API_NAME>:1.0.0
```


 Tag the docker image: 

```
docker tag <USERNAME>/<API_NAME>:<VERSION> dokku/<API_NAME>:latest
```
 Deploy the image via dokku: 
```
dokku tags:deploy <API_NAME> latest
```

 Go to your DNS provider

 Go to the advanced DNS records section 

 Add a new A record (the IP address of VPS / EC2 instances)

 the host name should match the name of whatever you named it via dokku 

 set TTL to automatic 

 let the DNS propagate (10 - 20 mins max)

 Now we will need to setup letencrypt + a cron job for i renewal in order to enable HTTPS

 Install lets encrypt: 
``` 

dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-leencrypt
```

 setup lets encrypt: 
```
dokku config:set --no-restart <API_NAME> 
DOKKU_LEENCRYPT_EMAIL=<YOUR_EMAIL_ADDR>
```

 Now we will need to setup the domain for the API. By default dokku will assume it's the name of the VPS / EC2 instance. So we will need to get rid of this. If you're following along on AWS you will first need to assign the VPS a hostname with the following command: 
``` 
sudo su - 
hostnamectl set-hostname <NEW_HOSTNAME_HERE>
```

 Now with that done we can continue with the following command: 


``` 
dokku domains:remove-global <NAME_OF_VPS/EC2_HOST>
```

``` 

dokku domains:remove <API_NAME> <VPS NAME>  (DOMAIN APP VHOS)
```

 Once that's done we need to check if it's removed with: 
``` 
dokku domains:report
```
 If it's not removed repeat the above steps or check the <a href="https://dokku.com/docs/getting-started/installation/">dokku</a> docs 

 If it is removed let's continue to add a custom domain name:

```
dokku domains:add <API_NAME> <DOMAIN_NAME>
```
 Check the por: 

```
dokku proxy:por <API_NAME>
```

 Assign the por to the API name. This should match whatever you've exposed in your Docker image

``` 
dokku proxy:por-add <API_NAME> http:80:<PORT_IN_DOCKER_IMAGE>
```

 At this point you should be able to get access via the browser (cannot get / message). If you see this it means the above steps have worked. You may get a 502 response from the server if DNS hasn't finished propogating.
 Now that we've assigned a domain name, configured the correct por, we can enable let's encrypt:

```
dokku leencrypt:enable <API_NAME>
```
 At the point of enabling letencrypt you may get some errors about the domain name. If so check if your advanced DNS config is correctly configured

 build fresh docker image on server & push to docker hub

```
docker build -t <USER>/app:1.0.1 .

```

 Tag the new release: 

``` 
docker tag <USERNAME>/<API_NAME>:<VERSION> dokku/<API_NAME>:latest
```

 Deploy the API to production ðŸ˜Ž : 

``` 
dokku tags:deploy <API_NAME> latest
```

 Your backend should now be successfully deployed

##

Frontend
 Add a URL redirect to your DNS config to the main domain name (assuming you've setup a sub domain such as `api.yourdomainname.com` for the API).
 Add the following A record to your DNS config: 
``` 
A Record @ <VERCEL_A_RECORD_ADDR> Automatic
```
Make sure frontend has .env variables correctly setup 
Deploy frontend 
Wait for DNS to propagate 
All done. Your API, DB & Frontend should now be successfully deployed
