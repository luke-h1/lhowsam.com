This was my first medium sized react project that I took on. At first taking on the Context API was a little bit overwhelming however as I continued to develop & dig in to how the React's Context API worked it became more and more enjoyable with every commit.


The application is very simple (it just pulls data from the github api about a user and displays that to you based on search term) however it proved to be extremely useful in reinforcing React concepts which I didn't feel too confident with. 


# Express / Node.JS implementation 

When I finished the Frontend for this I ran into a major problem. As you may be aware the github API requires authentication in order to access it's API (if you want a higher request limit)

If I deployed this as is someone could easily take advantage of the chrome developer tools and figure out my sensitive github keys + secrets. 
In order to avoid this risk I decided to build an Express API which would act as a proxy between my frontend and the github API. (see project <a href='https://lhowsam.com/projects/express-api'>here</a>)



I learnt how to build this API (and follow some best practices such as setting up rate limiting) by taking <a href="https://twitter.com/scotups">Scott Moss's </a> API design in Node v3 Frontend masters course. 
While I knew how to build a basic express server I wanted to gain some experience on how to build a robust & reliable API
