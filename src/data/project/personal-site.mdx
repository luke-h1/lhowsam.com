This is a project I've worked on since I started learning web development.


I use this project as a proving / training ground for myself and often find myself in the deep end of learning a new framework or trying a new technology (This has helped me get really comfortable with React & Gatsby for example). I am really enjoying working on this site and can't wait to continue to improve it with the latest technologies available.
