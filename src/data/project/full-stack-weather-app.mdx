In this project I built a simple frontend with Next (using React context for state management) to display results fetched from a weather API. I developed a custom express server with Typescript, Express & Node in order to hide sensitive API keys. I then setup a Digital ocean VPS to host the API. In order to deploy the API I setup a custom nginx server, letsencrypt & setup various security settings in order to harden server security.


Overall this was a really fun project and it helped me learn a lot about express, Next & custom deployment
