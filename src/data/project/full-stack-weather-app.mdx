In this project, I built a simple frontend with Next (using React context for state management) to display results fetched from a weather API. I developed a custom express server with Typescript, Express & Node in an effort to hide sensitive API keys and learn how to write an API in Express. I then setup a Digital ocean VPS to host the API. In order to deploy the API I setup a custom Nginx server, Letsencrypt & setup various security settings to harden server security.


Overall this was a really fun project and it helped me learn a lot about express, Next & custom deployment
