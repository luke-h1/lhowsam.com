I am a huge advocate for infrastructure automation & continuous integration as this allows developers to focus on innovating new features and solving new problems rather than being backlogged with maintaining existing infrastructure.


In this project I made Ansible playbooks & Bash scripts that automate the setup of Linux & Mac OS X workstations + servers. In addition to this I also setup an azure pipeline to run on pull requests made to the repository to ensure that any features added to the playbooks have no errors.


Having to manually setup my development environment when I switch Laptops or am setting up a work laptop is a real pain and often gets in the way of doing meaningful / productive work. This repository aims at reducing the time it takes from you opening your shiny new laptop or work laptop to writing code.
