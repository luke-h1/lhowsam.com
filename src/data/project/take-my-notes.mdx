Take my notes is one of my first full-stack projects. Initially, I built an Express rest API with MongoDB & a frontend with Next. I made a simple Express rest API with CRUD operations, authentication via JWT & state management with Redux. This was really fun and helped me learn a lot about database relationships, API design & React. 

<br /> 

I then refactored this project to use GraphQL, PostgresSQL, TypeORM, React, React Context, GraphQL codegen & tailwind css. 

<br /> 

Overall this project has been a real eye-opener on how great it is to work on end-to-end features. I mainly work on the frontend however I have been really enjoying developing features end to end and believe this is the direction I want to go in for future projects & work.
