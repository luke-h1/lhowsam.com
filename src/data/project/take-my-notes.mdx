Take my notes is one of my first full stack projects. Initially I built an Express rest API with MongoDB & a frontend with Next. I made a simple Express rest API with CRUD operations, authentication via json web tokens & a frontend build with Next & Redux. This was really fun and helped me learn a lot about database relationships, API design & React.

I'm currently still working on this project as I have decided to refactor this project quite heavily. I am now working on converting the project to use GraphQL, PostgresSQL, TypeORM, React, React Context, GraphQL codegen & tailwind css. 

<br /> 

Overall this project has been a real eye opener on how great it is to work on end to end features. I mainly work on the frontend however I have been really enjoying developing features end to end and believe this is the direction I want to go in for future projects / work
