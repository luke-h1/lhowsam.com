## Extending multiple classes in TypegraphQL


I'm currently working on a project that uses TypegraphQL & Node on the backend. I recently ran into a problem where I had a single <a href="https://typegraphql.com/docs/resolvers.html#input-types" target="_blank">InputType</a> that needed to extend multiple classes. 

##

Input types are used to define what a Mutation or query expects as types. An example of this would be:

```
  @Mutation(() => UserResponse)
  async register(
    @Arg('options') options: UsernamePasswordInput,
    @Ctx() { req }: MyContext,
  ): Promise<UserResponse> {
    const errors = validateRegister(options);
    if (errors) {
      return { errors };
    }
    const hashedPassword = await argon2.hash(options.password);
     // ... other logic removed for brevity's sake
   }
```

##

Here we have a mutation that returns a UserResponse and takes options as an argument which is of type UsernamePasswordInput. 

As an example UsernamePasswordInput would look something like... 


```
@InputType()
export class UsernamePasswordInput {
  @Field(() => String)
  email: string 

  @Field(() => String)
  password: string 
}
```

##


Here we are specifying that we expect an email and a password (both of type sring) to be sent from the client. 

and an example of UserResponse would be something like... 


```
@ObjectType()
class UserResponse {
  @Field(() => User, { nullable: true })
  user?: User;
}
```

## 

Here we are specifying that if all goes well we get a user back from this mutation. If things go wrong we return null. 

## 

A good way to manage input types in TypegraphQL that are used in multiple places in your project is to abstract that input type into it's own file (such as: RegisterInput, LoginInput etc.)



When your inputTypes start becoming more and more complex you may get to a point where you need to extend multiple classes. Unfortunately multiple inheritance is not built into Typescript. We cannot extend two classes.


## 

So, how can we get around this issue ? 



### Mixins 

To get around this issue we need to use something that is referred to as a Mixin in Typescript. Mixins relies on using Generics with class inheritance to extend a base class.

Here is an example that gets around this multiple class problem: 

```
// OkMixin.ts 
import { ClassType, Field, InputType } from "type-graphql";

export const OkMixin = <T extends ClassType>(BaseClass: T) => {
  @InputType()
  class OkInput extends BaseClass {
    @Field()
    ok: boolean;
  }
  return OkInput;
};
```

## 

Here we have a function that has an input type (called OkInput). It has a single field called 'ok' which is a boolean. This function takes in a class and returns this okInput. All it does is extend from this BaseClass that you pass in. You should also note that we're using a generic here in order to be type safe (we're passing the generic as the type of BaseClass).

## 

So how do we implement this mixin in the inputs we wish to extend ? 

Here is an example: 


```
// password input before converting to our new mixin 
@InputType()
export class PasswordInput {

  @MinLength(1)
  @Field()
  password: string;
}
```

## 

```
// password input after converting to utilize our new mixin

export const PasswordMixin = <T extends ClassType>(BaseClass: T) => {
  @InputType()
  class PasswordInput extends BaseClass {
    @MinLength(5)
    @Field()
    password: string;
  }
  return PasswordInput;
};
```

At this point we will have an issue using this in our example RegisterInput. If you're following along you should be getting the following error 


```
Error: Schema must contain uniquely named types but contains multiple types named "PasswordInput".
```

this is because we are registering multiple queries and mutations with the same name (see docs: https://typegraphql.com/docs/inheritance.html). 

To get around this we will need to decorate our mixin with the following: 

```
  @InputType({ isAbstract: true })
```

Now we can go ahead and use this in our RegisterInput

```
// single mixin example 
export class RegisterInput extends OkMixin(PasswordMixin(class {})) {
  @Field()
  @Length(1, 30)
  firstName: string;

  @Length(1, 30)
  @Field()
  lastName: string;

  @IsEmail()
  @IsEmailAlreadyExist({ message: 'Email already in use' })
  @Field()
  email: string;

} 
```

## 

```

// RegisterInput.ts 
export const anotherMixin = <T extends ClassType>(BaseClass: T) => {
  @InputType({ isAbstract: true })
  class PasswordInput extends BaseClass {
    @MinLength(5)
    @Field()
    accepted: boolean;
  }
  return PasswordInput;
};


@InputType()
export class RegisterInput extends OkMixin(PasswordMixin(anotherMixin(class {})),) {
  @Field()
  @Length(1, 30)
  firstName: string;

  @Length(1, 30)
  @Field()
  lastName: string;

  @IsEmail()
  @IsEmailAlreadyExist({ message: 'Email already in use' })
  @Field()
  email: string;
} 
```

## 

Now you can reload your GraphQL dashboard and now you should see that the RegisterInput is inherting the OkMixin
