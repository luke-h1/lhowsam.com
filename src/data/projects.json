In this project I made ansible playbooks and bash scripts to automate the setup of Linux & Mac OS X. In addition to this I also setup an Azure pipeline YAML linter to run on PRs to ensure that any new features added contain no errors."

I really enjoy spending time improving this site and thinking of new features I can add."
