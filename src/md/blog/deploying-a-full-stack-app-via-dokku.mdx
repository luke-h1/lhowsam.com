# Deploy with dokku to Digital ocean / AWS EC2 instance 

## 

### This deployment example uses Postgres, Redis & Node 


## 


## Cloud providers

Before getting started with the below steps you will need to open up the following ports regardless of whether you use Digital Ocean or AWS

- 80: For Nginx 
- http/https ports
- 22: For ssh 

AWS & Digital ocean provide Dokku images (among other useful images - https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace) which removes some of the pain points you can run into when setting Dokku up on a plain Ubuntu image.

##

**VPS / EC2**
- create new VPS with dokku image or install dokku yourself 
- go to VM IP address in browser
- check virtual hosts option
- ssh into VPS
- create a dokku app (API) `dokku apps:create <API_NAME>`
- install the postgres dokku plugin 

```ts 
sudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-postgres.git 
```

- create the database 

```ts
dokku postgres:create <DATABASE_NAME>
```
- Link postgres to the API 

```ts
dokku postgres:link <DATABASE_NAME> <API_NAME>
```

- Install redis: 
```ts
sudo dokku plugin:install 
https://github.com/dokku/dokku-redis.git
```

- create redis instance: 

```ts
sudo dokku redis:create <REDIS_INSTANCE_NAME>
```

- Link the redis instance to the API 

```ts
dokku redis:link <REDIS_INSTANCE_NAME> <API_NAME>
```

- run the following command & make postgres & redis are running
```ts 
docker container list
``` 


##

**Locally** 

* comment out any old migrations 

* Generate an initial migration (this will be responsible for creating the initial tables on the production database)  

* Create a repository on Docker hub 

* Create a Dockerfile image locally (this will be responsible for building & running the backend for production) with 

```ts
docker build -t <USER>/app:1.0.0
```

* Push the Docker image up to Docker hub 
```ts
docker push <USER>/app:1.0.0
```
##

**VPS / EC2** 
* Pull the Docker image you've pushed up to Docker hub: 


```ts
docker pull <USERNAME>/<API_NAME>:1.0.0
```


* Tag the docker image: 

```ts
docker tag <USERNAME>/<API_NAME>:<VERSION> dokku/<API_NAME>:latest
```
* Deploy the image via dokku: 
```ts
dokku tags:deploy <API_NAME> latest
```

* Go to your DNS provider

* Go to the advanced DNS records section 

* Add a new A record (the IP address of VPS / EC2 instances)

* the host name should match the name of whatever you named it via dokku 

* set TTL to automatic 

* let the DNS propagate (10 - 20 mins max)

* Now we will need to setup letencrypt + a cron job for its renewal in order to enable HTTPS

* install letsencrypt: 
```ts
dokku config:set --no-restart <API_NAME> 
DOKKU_LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=<YOUR_EMAIL_ADDR>
```

* Now we will need to setup the domain for the API. By default dokku will assume it's the name of the VPS / EC2 instance. So we will need to get rid of this. If you're following along on AWS you will first need to assign the VPS a hostname with the following command: 
```ts 
sudo su - 
hostnamectl set-hostname <NEW_HOSTNAME_HERE>
```

* Now with that done we can continue with the following command: 


```ts 
dokku domains:remove-global <NAME_OF_VPS/EC2_HOST>
```

```ts 

dokku domains:remove <API_NAME> <VPS NAME>  (DOMAIN APP VHOSTS)
```

* Once that's done we need to check if it's removed with: 
```ts 
dokku domains:report
```
* If it's not removed repeat the above steps or check the <a href="https://dokku.com/docs/getting-started/installation/">dokku</a> docs 

* If it is removed let's continue to add a custom domain name:

```ts
dokku domains:add <API_NAME> <DOMAIN_NAME>
```
* Check the ports: 

```ts
dokku proxy:ports <API_NAME>
```

* Assign the ports to the API name. This should match whatever you've exposed in your Docker image

```ts 
dokku proxy:ports-add <API_NAME> http:80:<PORT_IN_DOCKER_IMAGE>
```

* At this point you should be able to get access via the browser (cannot get / message). If you see this it means the above steps have worked. You may get a 502 response from the server if DNS hasn't finished propogating.
* Now that we've assigned a domain name, configured the correct ports, we can enable let's encrypt:

```ts
dokku letsencrypt:enable <API_NAME>
```
* At the point of enabling letencrypt you may get some errors about the domain name. If so check if your advanced DNS config is correctly configured

* build fresh docker image on server & push to docker hub

```ts
docker build -t <USER>/app:1.0.1

```

* Tag the new release: 

```ts 
docker tag <USERNAME>/<API_NAME>:<VERSION> dokku/<API_NAME>:latest
```

* Deploy the API to production ðŸ˜Ž : 

```ts 
dokku tags:deploy <API_NAME> latest
```

* Your backend should now be successfully deployed

##

**Frontend**
* Add a URL redirect to your DNS config to the main domain name (assuming you've setup a sub domain such as `api.yourdomainname.com` for the API).
* Add the following A record to your DNS config: 
```ts 
A Record @ <VERCEL_A_RECORD_ADDR> Automatic
```
* Make sure frontend has .env variables correctly setup 
* Deploy frontend 
* Wait for DNS to propagate 
* All done. Your API, DB & Frontend should now be successfully deployed
