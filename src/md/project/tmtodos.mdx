tmtodos is a fullstack todo site. Initially, I built an Express rest API with MongoDB & a frontend with Next. I made a simple Express rest API with CRUD operations, authentication via JWT & state management with Redux. 
This was really fun and helped me learn a lot about database relationships, API design & React. 

##

I then refactored this project to use GraphQL, PostgresSQL, TypeORM, React, GraphQL codegen & tailwind css. Once finished with this I then deployed this project to Digital ocean via a service called Dokku
