<a href="https://tmtodos.me">tmtodos</a> is a fullstack todo site. While simple in the features it surfaces to the user, I learnt a lot from this. Initially, I built an Express rest API with MongoDB & a frontend with Next which enabled authenticated users to perform create, read & delete functionality on todos. I made a simple Express rest API with CRUD operations, authentication via JWT & state management with Redux. 


##

After a while I decided to refactor this project to different technologies. I refactored this project to use GraphQL, PostgreSQL, TypeORM, Next.js, GraphQL codegen and Tailwind css. After this I then deployed the backend to Digital Ocean and the frontend to Vercel.

I then decided to re-deploy this site to AWS. I used a service called Dokku to deploy the backend to AWS EC2 and re deployed the frontend to Vercel.

Overall this project was an eye opener on which technologies I most like working with (building full stack applications is really satisifying) and the importance of picking the correct tech-stack to start a project with. Initially the tech stack I chose to start this project was simply not suitable (i.e. Redux was overkill for this project).
