This is a project I've worked on since I started learning web development.


I use this project as a proving / training ground for myself and often find myself in the deep end of learning a new framework or trying a new technology (This has helped me get really comfortable with React & Gatsby for example). I am really enjoying working on this site and can't wait to continue to improve it with the latest technologies available


# Future plans 

Move away from Gatsby âœ… - if your viewing this post then I have moved this site away from Gatsby and over to Next JS. I think Gatsby is a great SSG but I don't like dealing with the Graphql layer (while extremely useful for sourcing data from multiple different APIs it can be frustrating to work with sometimes) and would rather deal with the APIs that gatsby utilizes directly.
