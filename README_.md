# personal-site
Source code for my personal portfolio

## Improvements 
setup sass workflow & environment
look into different designs for color theme + layouts (parallax effect & UI design daily probably)
use something along the lines of bemm to keep css simple
look into how to deploy this with vercel or heroku (mainly due to the sass setup)
create an assets folder & import all resources from current site
look into creating blob css effects instead of the blocks that are currently used (skills / expertise section)
