# personal-site
Source code for my personal portfolio


## Branches: 
 * main - current deployed code 
 * testing - features currently being worked on 


## future plans: 
  * turn into a react site once comfortable enough with react and implement the serviceWorker & useState to cache pages in order to create a snappy experience 
    * rethink design of page 
      * potentially use a framework such as Material UI 
      * parallax effect
      * more user friendly cards (projects section)
