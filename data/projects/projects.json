    "body": "I am a huge advocate for infrastructure automation & continuous integration as this allows developers to focus on innovating new features and solving new problems rather than being backlogged with maintaining existing infrastructure. In this project I made Ansible playbooks & Bash scripts that automate the setup of Linux & Mac OS X workstations + servers. In addition to this I also setup an azure pipeline to run on pull requests made to the repository to ensure that any features added to the playbooks have no errors."

It has been through many iterations (Vanilla javascript to React, React to Gatsby, CSS to SASS and SASS to styled components to name a few...) and it has helped me challenge myself and learn a lot about web development in general. I've really enjoyed spending time improving this site and thinking of new features I can add to this site."
