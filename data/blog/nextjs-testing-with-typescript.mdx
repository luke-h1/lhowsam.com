title: testing Next JS with jest & typescript 
date: "2021-01-26"
summary: Sharing my thoughts on how to get setup with jest + typescript on Next JS
---


Recently I tried Next js and started to really enjoying developing sites with it. I've found next js to have a really smooth development process, the file structure to be well organised & the fast refresh dev server to be blazingly fast. In addition to this you will get <a href='https://dev.to/prateekvijayvergiya/server-side-rendering-with-next-js-1896' target='_blank'>server side rendering out the box</a> which means you are able to update content without re building your project and your site can be crawled easily due to next sending down pre-rendered HTML for each page that a user visits


# What we'll cover
* 1 - Install Next JS 
* 2 - Typescript: install + configure 
* 3 - Eslint: Install + configure 
* 4 - Jest & react testing library: install, configure & test

<br /> 

# Installing Next js 

To start, open up a terminal and cd into a folder where you want to start this project. For this we are going to use the create-next-app which will create a basic next app to get started with.

```
npx create-next-app .
```

This will create a new next app in the current directory / folder you've chosen

# Installing + configuring typescript 

To start off a basic typescript project I am going to leave the tsconfig in a loose mode (for brevity's sake). Having to deal with strict type errors will only hinder the point of this tutorial. 




``` 
npm i -D typescript @types/react @types/node 
```

Now that we have typescript installed we can begin renaming .js files to .ts & .tsx files. You generally want to name files that return JSX with .tsx and files that only contain javascript with .ts Your directory structure should look like the following: 

<Image 
alt={`picture of directory structure`}
src={`/static/images/next-testing/file-dir.png`}
width={420}
height={800}
priority 
/>


Now that typescript and the relevant types are installed you can now go ahead and run the following command in order for next to generate a tsconfig.json file (next will automatically detect that you're running a typescript project)

```
npm run dev 
```


You should now have a tsconfig.json that looks like the following: 


````
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "lib": [
      "dom",
      "dom.iterable",
      "esnext"
    ],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": false,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsx": "preserve"
  },
  "include": [
    "next-env.d.ts",
    "**/*.ts",
    "**/*.tsx"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules"
  ]
}
````


# Eslint installation and configuration

In order to configure eslint we're going to use npx to use the airbnb eslint config. Some things will needed to be altered in order for this configuration to play nice with Next JS 


```
npx eslint --init 
```

This command will walk you through a series of options. Pick the following options: 

``` 
How would you like to use ESlint ? :
* To check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style
```


``` 
What type of modules does your project use? :
* None of these
```

``` 
Which framework does your project use? :
* React
```


```
Does your project use TypeScript?
* Yes 
```


```
Where does your code run?
* Browser 
```


```
How would you like to define a style for your project?
* Use a popular style guide 
```

```
What format do you want your config file to be in?
* JSON 
```


```
Which style guide do you want to follow?
* AirBnb
```

```
 Would you like to install them now with npm?
 * Yes 
```


After the above is done your project will be configured with the base airbnb config. In order for eslint to not get angry about certain conventions that Next follows (such as how Links work) we will have to make a few modifications to the eslintrc file: 


```

{
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es2021": true,
    "jest": true
  },
  "extends": ["plugin:react/recommended", "airbnb"],
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaFeatures": {
      "jsx": true
    },
    "ecmaVersion": 12
  },
  "plugins": ["react", "@typescript-eslint"],
  "rules": {
    "react/react-in-jsx-scope": "off",
    "no-console": "warn",
    "import/extensions": "off",
    "react/jsx-filename-extension": [
      0,
      { "extensions": [".tsx, .ts, .js, .jsx"] }
    ],
    "react/jsx-props-no-spreading": "off",
    "jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid": "off",
    "jsx-a11y/anchor-has-content": "off",
    "import/prefer-default-export": "off",
  },
  "globals": {
    "React": "writable"
  }
}
```


To Explain: Here we are telling eslint not to complaing about the following: 

* react/react-in-jsx-scope - don't complain about React not been in scope when JSX is present (introduced in React 17)

* no-console - don't error when we use console.log()

* import/extensions - don't tell us to import files with their filenames included. i.e:

`import Component from './Component.tsx'`



* react/jsx-props-no-spreading - don't complain about when we use the spread operator on props 

* jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid - don't complain when we use an anchor tag without a href (for Links) 

* jsx-a11y/anchor-has-content - same as above 

* import/prefer-default-export - don't complain when we use `export const` instead of `export default`

Lastly we will add two new scripts to the project's package.json: 
```
 "lint": "eslint \"./*.{js, jsx,ts,tsx}\" --quiet",
 "lint:fix": "eslint \"./*.{js, jsx,ts,tsx}\" --quiet --fix",
```


# Jest + testing library setup 

In order to setup jest and react testing library we will run the following commands: 


``` 
npm i -D @types/jest @types/testing-library__jest-dom babel-jest jest ts-jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

We will then need to create a directory in the root of the project which will be responsible for holding the needed jest config files: 

```
mkdir jest 
```

Now we will create two config files inside of the jest directory: 

### jest.config.js 

```
// Jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  clearMocks: true,
  coverageDirectory: '.coverage',
  testRegex: '(.*|(\\.|/)(test|spec))\\.tsx?$',

  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['./jest.setup.js'],
};
```

ClearMocks will help prevent issues with persistence of mock data between tset runs. the setupFilesAfterEnv will run before each test 


### jest.setup.js 

```
// Jest.setup.js
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
```

This enables access to the addition assertions provided by the `@testing-library/jest-dom` package


Only one more config file ðŸŽ‰

The last config file you will need is called .babelrc (create this at the root of your project). You won't need any package for babel to run - it's handled automatically via Next. Jest however will need this file to auto-detect how to transform the code before running tests. 
Add this to the file: 

````
{
  "presets": ["next/babel"]
}

````


Write your test file 


Create a file `index.test.tsx` in the root of the project and add some tests ! 

```
import React from 'react';

const sum = (a: number, b: number) => {
  return a + b;
};

test('Dummy unit test', () => {
  const actual = sum(1, 2);
  expect(actual).toBe(3);
});
```
