This was a project I did in order for my frontend (<a href='https://lhowsam.com/projects/github-searcher'>github searcher project</a>) 
to not expose it's API keys + secrets. I made an express + node server that acts as a proxy between my frontend & the github API. 


I created custom routes which made requests on behalf of my frontend to talk to and send back data from the github API. I mostly focus on the frontend but this was a really fun project to work on. I think I will experiment with a full stack project using React & express in the future
