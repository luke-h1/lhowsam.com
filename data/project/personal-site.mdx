This is a project I've worked on since I started learning web development. This is by far the longest and arguably the most complex project I have worked on since getting into web development.


I use this project as a proving / training ground for myself and often find myself in the deep end of learning a new framework or trying a new technology (This has helped me get really comfortable with React & Gatsby for example). This has helped me challenge myself and learn about how to go about managing + developing a large project. I am really enjoying working on this site and can't wait to continue to improve it with the latest technologies available



## Future plans 

I plan to move away from Vercel (where this site is currently hosted) and try AWS serverless for hosting. Currently Vercel restrict serverless functions to around 20 per site. This is currently ok for this site however I want to ensure that this site can scale as I start to add more and more features 

Move away from Gatsby âœ… - if your viewing this post then I have moved this site away from Gatsby and over to Next JS. I think Gatsby is a great SSG but I don't like dealing with the Graphql layer (while extremely for sourcing data from multiple different mediums it can be frustrating to work with sometimes) and would rather deal with the Node APIs that gatsby utilizes directly.
