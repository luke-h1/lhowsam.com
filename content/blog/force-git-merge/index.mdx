Isolating features into seperate branches is a really common practice for most developers. By seperating features, bug fixes or working on experiments you can avoid a lot of problems and keep your master / development branches clean. 
<br /> 
At some point you may reach a state where you want to integrate your feature branch with the rest of your project. This is where the <strong>git merge</strong> command comes into play 
<br /> 
I recently ran into an issue where my feature branch conflicted with the dev branch. If I tried to merge my feature into the dev branch I would have had to deal with endless conflicts. This is where I needed to force the merge into my development branch 
<br /> 
<br /> 

<strong>WARNING: ⚠️ Do not do this if you are working on a project with other people. </strong>

<h1>Preparing to force the merge</h1>

Let's assume you want to merge branch <strong>hotfix</strong> into your <strong>master</strong> branch but the changes made in hotfix conflict with master. You know the changes in <strong>hotfix</strong> won't overwrite any important code in <strong>master</strong> and you need to get this fix deployed. 
<br /> 
<br /> 

<h2>1 - Preparing to merge</h2>

Before you touch anything ensure that your local repository (feature branch) is up to date with the latest changes from your remote origin with a: 
<br />

```javascript
git fetch && git status
```

<br />
If anything shows up here move it to your desktop or stash it
<br />
<br /> 


<h2>2 - Prepare master / your main branch</h2> 

```
git checkout master && git pull 
``` 

<br />
<h2>3 - Dress up your feature branch</h2>

```
git checkout feature-branch
```

```javascript
git merge --strategy=ours master
```

<br /> 
<h2>4 - Go in for the kill</h2> 

```
git checkout master
```

```javascript
git merge --no-ff feature-branch
```

<br /> 
This merge approach will add one commit on top of your master / main branch which pastes in whatever is in your feature branch without complaining about conflicts.
