Welcome to my new blog. This is about the 4th time I've attempted to create a decent looking blog page. I've only created this one blog post even after all of those attempts

My goal in creating a blog page is to write more about things I have learned, weird bugs I have encountered, new tools I try in my applications and various other things.
