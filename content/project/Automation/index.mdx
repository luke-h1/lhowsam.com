I am a huge advocate for infrastructure automation & continuous integration as this allows developers to focus on innovating new features and solving new problems rather than being backlogged with maintaining existing infrastructure. In this project I made Ansible playbooks & Bash scripts that automate the setup of Linux & Mac OS X workstations + servers. In addition to this I also setup an azure pipeline to run on pull requests made to the repository to ensure that any features added to the playbooks have no errors.

test code block 

```

```js  
import Code from '../components/code';

export default {
  pre: Code,
};
```
