This is a project I've worked on since I started learning web development. It has been through many iterations (Vanilla javascript to React, React to Gatsby, CSS to SASS and SASS to styled components to name a few...) and it has helped me challenge myself and learn a lot about web development in general. I've really enjoyed spending time improving this site and thinking of new features I can add to this site.
